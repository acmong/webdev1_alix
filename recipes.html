<b>Instructions:</b><br/>
Prepare the meatballs:</br>
<ol type="i">
<li>In a large mixing bowl, <u>combine</u> the ground beef, ground pork, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, milk, egg, chopped onion, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. <u>Mix</u> until all the ingredients are well combined.</li>
Shape the mixture into meatballs, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter.
<u>Heat</u> olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook until they are browned on all sides and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes. <u>Transfer</u> the cooked meatballs to a plate and set them aside. </br></br>

<li>Prepare the tomato sauce:</li></br>

In the same skillet, add a little more olive oil if needed. Add the minced garlic and chopped onion. Saut√© until the onion becomes translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
<u>Stir</u>in the crushed tomatoes, chopped basil, chopped oregano, sugar (if using), salt, and black pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer.
Return the cooked meatballs to the skillet, and let them simmer in the sauce for an additional 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. </br></br>

<li>Cook the spaghetti:</li><br/>

In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt and the spaghetti. Cook according to the package instructions until al dente, usually about 8-10 minutes.
Drain the spaghetti in a colander.</br></br>

Serve:</br>

Place a portion of cooked spaghetti on each plate or bowl.
Top the spaghetti with the tomato sauce and meatballs.
Garnish with additional chopped fresh basil or grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade spaghetti!</br></br>
